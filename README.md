# SimpleX-Calculator

This project uses the Python programming language to construct a text-based calculator with limited functionality that allows a user to enter one or two values depending on the operation to be performed, and the code does the operation and delivers the appropriate result.   Users basically follow the text-based instructions given on the terminal, and if the steps are followed in order, the right result is printed on the terminal. Because Python is a back-end language, there is no graphical user interface (GUI) accessible to interact with the calculator.

## UX
__SimpleX-Calculator__

* User Objectives

  *   The user should be able to add two integers and receive the correct answer.

  *   The user must be able to subtract two integers and arrive at the correct answer.

  *   The user must be able to multiply two integers and obtain the correct answer.

  *   The user must be able to divide two integers and come up with the correct answer.

  *   The user should be able to correctly compute the square root of an integer.

  *   If a user enters an incorrect number as input, the user should receive feedback.

## Flowchart
The flowchart was created using the Lucid app and it captures the flow of operation created for the Calculator.
