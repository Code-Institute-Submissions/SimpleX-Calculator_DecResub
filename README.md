# SimpleX-Calculator

This project uses the Python programming language to construct a text-based calculator with limited functionality that allows a user to enter one or two values depending on the operation to be performed, and the code does the operation and delivers the appropriate result.   Users basically follow the text-based instructions given on the terminal, and if the steps are followed in order, the right result is printed on the terminal. Because Python is a back-end language, there is no graphical user interface (GUI) accessible to interact with the calculator.

## UX

__SimpleX-Calculator__

The app was created with easy functionalities for anyone to carry out numerical functions in their daily activities. The users will be able to the calculate basic maths functions and it is clear enough for any individual of age (both old and young) to access it without limitations.

## Flowchart
The flowchart was created using the Lucid app and it captures the flow of operation created for the Calculator.
 
 * See flowchart below:

**User Objectives** 

  *   The user should be able to add two integers and receive the correct answer.

  *   The user must be able to subtract two integers and arrive at the correct answer.

  *   The user must be able to multiply two integers and obtain the correct answer.

  *   The user must be able to divide two integers and come up with the correct answer.

  *   The user should be able to correctly compute the square root of an integer.

  *   If a user enters an incorrect number as input, the user should receive feedback.

## Features
 This section shows all existing features created to make the calculator functional.

__Existing Features__
* Option '1' represents Addition ('+') operator for the sum of two numbers.
* Option '2' represents Subtraction ('-') operator for the difference between two numbers.
* Option '3' represents Multiply ('*') operator for the product of two numbers.
* Option '4' represents Division ('/') operator to divide two numbers.
* Option '5' for Square Root ('√') operator to retrieve the square root of a number.
