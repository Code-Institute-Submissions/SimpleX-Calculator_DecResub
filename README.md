This project uses the Python programming language to construct a text-based calculator with limited functionality that allows a user to enter one or two values depending on the operation to be performed, and the code does the operation and delivers the appropriate result.   Users basically follow the text-based instructions given on the terminal, and if the steps are followed in order, the right result is printed on the terminal. Because Python is a back-end language, there is no graphical user interface (GUI) accessible to interact with the calculator.
